## Mailing lists

MARL has two distinct mailing lists. A description of the purpose for each is described below. If you have any questions about which to use in a specific case, please contact Isabelle. 


- marl-research@nyu.edu
    
    The **marl-research** mailing list includes the core faculty, postdoctoral researchers, doctoral students, and full-time staff members of MARL, along with some research affiliates. This list should be used to reach the research team about internal matters, meetings, and events. *Machine Listening (ML) meetings are open to the core research team specifically. Correspondence about ML meetings should therefore use this mailing list.*


- marl-everybody@nyu.edu
    
    The **marl-everybody** mailing list includes the wider MARL community and reaches a much broader audience, such as NYU masters or undergraduate students with aligned research interests, MARL alumni, collaborators from other institutions, and former research affiliates. This list should be used for larger event announcements. *Music and Cognitive Neuroscience (MCN) meetings are open to the wider MARL community. Communication about MCN meetings should therefore use this mailing list.*
