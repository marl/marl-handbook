# MARL Handbook

```{caution}
This is a work in progress. Really, not even in progress.  It's planned to be in progress.

Nothing to see here.

Move along.

The MARL handbook is intended as a common resource to help members of the lab become more effective researchers.

## How to use this handbook

This isn't necessarily exciting reading, and you're not likely to sit down and read this handbook through in one sitting.  **We get it.**

Here's how we recommend to use the book:

1. Read through the first section, **Getting started** first.  This is relatively short, and covers:
    a. Expected behavior of lab members,
    b. Expectations around authorship and collaboration, and
    c. Pointers for basic day-to-day logistical issues.

2. Read [Computing resources](computing), and optionally the
   remaining sections of **Lab resources**.

3. The remaining sections may be more useful as reference, and since
   new lab members come from a variety of backgrounds, we will not
   recommend a one-size-fits-all approach here.  Instead, we recommend
   skimming the contents first to get a sense of what's here, and
   then referring back as needed.

4. Complete the [Onboarding checklist](checklist).
