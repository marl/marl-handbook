# âœ… Publication checklist

This checklist is intended to help you ensure that your article is in good shape for peer review and eventual publication.

## Pre-submission checklist

Complete this checklist before sending your article out for peer
review.

- [ ] Free of typos.  Use a spell checker!
- [ ] All mathematical notation is defined prior to its first use
- [ ] All acronyms and abbreviations are defined prior to use
- [ ] All figures and tables are referenced in the text
- [ ] All figures have readable font sizes (at least footnote size relative to main text)
- [ ] All figures have descriptive captions
- [ ] If your publication venue uses "double-blind" review, ensure that your paper is in "draft" mode and there is no author-identfying information included.
- [ ] Tag your final submitted draft in git / Overleaf.

## Final submission checklist

Once your paper has been accepted for publication, complete this
checklist.

- [ ] Authors have been fully identified, and their individual contributions are documented appropriately.
- [ ] Software and data have been archived in a publicly accessible repository, e.g., GitHub, Zenodo, or Figshare.
- [ ] All sources of funding and support have been acknowledged.  If
  you're unsure, ask your PI.  Don't forget [HPC!](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/about/acknowledgement-statement)
- [ ] Tag your paper repository again to indicate the final version.
