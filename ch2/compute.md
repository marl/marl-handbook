# Computing resources

While much of the day-to-day work we do in the lab can be done on a personal computer, our primary resource
for computing is the [High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc).
The HPC can be used for large distributed jobs, but also provides a notebook server for a more interactive
workflow that you may be used to.

To use the HPC, you will need to apply for an account, and list your PI as a faculty sponsor.
See the [documentation](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/accessing-hpc/getting-and-renewing-an-account) for details on how to do this.

# Recommendations for HPC use

First, make sure to read through the documentation on how to access the cluster.
If you are off-campus, you will need to go through either the VPN or an SSH gateway, as described [here](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/accessing-hpc#h.5v318r5hu99p).

You will need some basic familiarity with the UNIX command line, see [here](unix) for a quick overview.
